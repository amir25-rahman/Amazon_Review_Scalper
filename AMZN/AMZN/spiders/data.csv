"4,175 people found this helpful","Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2020","I purchased this as i always do with the latest and greatest echo devices. This was a sour Disappointment for someone who is used to amazon improving on their devices yearly.Complaints:1. They shipped my Black echo, with a WHITE cord, In the past the cord color matched the device, why change?2. The charger is Noticeably larger and cheaper looking, sporting rounded corners and a bulky design.3. The sound quality vs my 2nd Gen Dot has actually gotten worse. This speaker lacks bass and is very ""hollow"" sounding. The gen 2 speaker blows the gen 3 out of the water, IMO they majorly cheaped out to get you other features like an Ai core and a bulkier bigger device, in bigger packaging, requiring more shiping cost, a poor trade off for quality.4. Its fabric mesh, and construction seem cheaper than previous generations, it is significantly lighter than a previous gen (my guess is a small speaker magnet and more airspace due to its odd shape)5. Its small, i thought the ball was cool, big and substantially, Like a speaker should be, but its tennis ball sized and looks like a childs toy, or a cheap bluetooth speaker you got for $5.....6. It has this awful ""sheen"" to the plastic that makes it look like some Chinese garbage product....7. The buttons feel awful and cheap compared to previous generations.Pros:It has underglow now.Overall its clear this product was rushed, or had a strict budget in which a lot of its features, and quality were stripped. The gen2 dots are amazing, and if you weren;t going to make them better, why release a gen 3?It costs more, its much much worse in basically every category, and in my opinion, is a complete fail. Its supreme selling a brick because you want it. Buy a gen2, you'll be happier",A Major DOWNGRADE,,1.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Twilight Blue,Configuration: Echo Dot,Zachary Riley,Verified Purchase
"1,667 people found this helpful","Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2020","This new 4th Gen Echo Dot brings a new spherical shape to the Echo Dot lineup.  It is about the same width as the previous Echo 3rd Gen, but since it is a ball now it is obviously a little taller.  The blue light is now on the bottom.  Here are my thought so far:THE GOOD- Bottom ring light.  The new blue light on the bottom actually illuminates the surface that the Dot is sitting on.  This actually makes the light considerably more noticeable, especially if sitting on a semi-reflective surface.- Slightly better sound.  The actual speaker hardware is the same as the 3rd Gen Dot, but this one sounds slightly better to my ear.  This could be because the speaker is pointed toward the front, instead of pointing straight up like it was in the previous model.THE BAD- Aesthetics.  This is personal opinion of course, but I think I prefer the smaller, less noticeable ""hockey puck"" shape of the previous models.  This one is closer to a softball, and stands out much more.  Sure it might be better for creating sound, but I don't use Dots for music listening anyway.  If I wanted to do that I would use a regular Echo or Echo Studio, which of course sound much better than this Dot.  The whole point of the Dot for me was to use it in locations where I wanted a small device that doesn't take up much space.- Price.  The old Gen 3 Dot is now $10 cheaper than this version, and it is really hard for me to justify choosing this Gen 4.  It really seems like you are just paying for the new shape and very slightly better sound, but that doesn't currently seem worth it to me.  There just aren't enough improvements from what I've seen so far.All in all, this new Gen 4 Dot might be worth it for you if you really dig the ball shape and bottom ring light, but otherwise I'd have to recommend sticking with the Gen 3 for $10 less.",A VERY slight upgrade(?),,3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Charcoal,Configuration: Echo Dot,C,Verified Purchase

I recently bought a echo dot 3rd generation on prime day special but couldn't help wonder if the sound quality was different. The 4th generation device's sound is much better. It is a clear and less muffled. Which is great if I didn't need to connect it to anything or what to use any Alexa features.

I had some similar issues with the 3rd generation but it just took a few extra tries. I even tried to get assistance and they sent me the instructions already included then switched me over to someone else who wanted to start me over again with the same basic help links.This is infuriating because not only does this item not work as its supposed to but I also returned my functional 3rd generation which is now double the price and unavailable.,Disappointing.,,1.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Twilight Blue,Configuration: Echo Dot,Mira,Verified Purchase

56 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2020","I live in a 27' RV. I bought this junkie thing to ""upgrade"" my Dot gen 3. I'm fairly computer literate and have set up many dots over the years for myself and friends. This one is by far the worst Echo I've ever seen. It refuses proper setup, can't stay connected to Wi-Fi, and has really bad bass - as I found on those rare times I've been able to get it to work for a few minutes. I thought I could use them both to cover more of the sound spectrum when playing music, but this new (much lower quality) dot won't play music if the other dot is playing. (This problem has been fixed.) Bottom line: if you have a Echo Dot Gen 3, seriously, don't waste your money! Gen 4 is junk and the Gen 3 has way better sound. I think Amazon has been paying reviewers to give it a good review. If you look at my other reviews, I tend to look for the good in what I review, this one has very little good to talk about. (Disclaimer: it may be this particular unit, but the package arrived undamaged.)Update: A very pleasant Amazon employee contacted me after I left the original review. We worked on getting the Dot set up and I agreed to try it out until mid-January to give it a fair trial. It's now been a couple of weeks and my opinion of it hasn't changed. It sounds more tinny, even after tweaking the equalizer settings. The Gen 3 sounds almost like a Bose speaker by comparison. And as far as I've discovered so far, the Gen 4 does nothing that the Gen 3 couldn't do.Update: It's been a couple of months. I didn't return it because doing so would be too much of a hassle and I figured I would give it to someone who's just starting out. I have been using it, though, to give it a chance. My initial opinion of it hasn't changed. I can't find anything about it that makes it better than my Gen 3. At this point, I feel like it was a total waste of cash.

20 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2021","I am not a technophobe by any means but I have not bought into all the ""smart gizmos"" until fairly recently. So far I like the dot, mainly because I can talk fast and natural and Alexa understands me perfectly.  You can also change the key word (or whatever it's called) to a few other things, which I can't do with Google.Now for people complaining about the audio quality: this thing is a tiny little speaker with a tiny power draw and in my mind will never sound good for music (physics and whatnot). If you are someone who actually listens to music you already know that this will sound like garbage and probably already have an amp/receiver and decent speakers or monitors. Alexa's voice is ok, even if she sounds a little muddled, kind of like someone talking to you when they are not facing you. It does have an aux output and bluetooth so hooking it up to real speakers is a breeze.The only things I think Amazon should fix is the very stiff ugly cord with the giant brick. Also I have the blue and black models and I think the blue is kind of ugly and the black is very black (the kind of black that really doesn't exist in nature.) These complaints are just nitpicking and I still like the product.Update: When I first got this it was kind of a pain to get certain things functioning such as my lights, but Alexa is able to learn fairly quickly what I mean when I say certain things. I have one dot in the bedroom and one in my office, and at first Alexa had no idea how to turn the lights off or on without being specific. I had to say, ""Alexa, turn on the office lights"" at first, but now I just say, ""Alexa, turn on the lights"" or simply, ""Alexa, lights,"" and if I am in the office the office lights turn on and if I am in the bedroom the bedroom lights turn on, just as it should be. Alexa had to learn this, it's like she had no common sense at first, but over time she ""matures."" It may be a little frustrating at first but give it a chance.Update: OK this thing is getting annoying. Everything about this device is trying to get you to buyAmazon products. For example, it connected to my printer and now I get messages about buying toner all of the time.  I think Amazon made this thing like a softball so when you get mad at it you can throw it out the window. I'm probably going to use google more often now and use alexa only for turning on my lights. Even if you turn every option off in the settings it still just rambles on and on.Another update: This thing has gotten so frustrating to use. One day I will ask Alexa when does Walmart open, and she will respond with the time the store that is closest to me opens. A day later if I ask the same question it will respond by telling me when a random walmart 50 miles away is open. If I ask specifically when does the Walmart in *insert city here* open the response is, ""Sorry I can't do that."" This thing sucks. Will stick with Google products from now on.FINAL UPDATE: So after I changed my review to one star Amazon called my phone while I was sleeping. Seriously Amazon? I threw away my Amazon products and cancelled my music subscription, although I will keep my Prime membership because I do like their tv shows. Now my home is Google Home equipped and I have a Google Assistant device in every room now and subscribed to You Tube music. So much better!! Amazon is all about getting you to subscribe to all of their services so you will have a monthly bill instead of buying a stand alone product.

29 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2021","I honestly can't believe how much worse this is than the previous1. Speaker quality is atrocious. I mean, actually painful to listen to. I put the speaker next to my Samsung Galaxy S8 (notorious for having a terrible single speaker design) and swapped the music between the phone and the speaker and the 5 year old phone sounded WAY better, that's how big of a downgrade we're talking here. The GEN 3 is perfectly listenable, the Gen 4 is unusable. Oh and there is no bass. Might as well be NEGATIVE bass with how awful it sounds.To give an idea of what it sounds like, it sounds like you put the speaker up to the end of a 50 foot long PVC pipe and you listened to the music from the other end of that pipe. That's not an exaggeration, it has that exact sound signature.2. The voice recognition is equally worse. I basically have to stare directly at the Gen 4 within about a 5 foot range in order for it to hear or understand me. Meanwhile, the Gen 3 can be in a completely different room and it'll understand what I say pretty well.3. Something changed with the hardware or software side as well because the machine is CONSTANTLY pausing my music. Music will be playing on the ""Everywhere"" group and all of a sudden the Gen 4 will stop and all the others will still be playing. Also, sometimes I'll tell it to turn a light on and it'll say that it can't detect the light. So I'll go to a Gen 3 and say the same thing, and the light will turn on. It just does this randomly from time to time. I ONLY have this problem with the Gen 4.4. The round design is nice, but it's also completely not versatile. The others can be stowed away anywhere or mounted on the walls. This one? Better have a big open area to place it and you're definitely not putting it on the wall in any logical way.Terrible, I hate this thing.

14 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2021","I was one of the early adopters of the original Amazon Echo. I was thrilled that it could hear me across the room and play music or activate smart devices, as I had needed to rig something up myself with Dragon Naturally Speaking to do the same thing in the past.Since then, the entire Alexa ecosystem has gone to seed in several different ways. The quality of voice recognition has gradually declined; it no longer recognizes simple voice commands like ""turn off bedroom"" (to which it will sometimes give the hilarious response ""did you mean 'bedroom'?""). These are not merely failures of recognition; I've had times when it heard the soundtrack I wanted to play perfectly, I had already purchased said soundtrack, and it still asked me to sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited. But then if I'd ask ""play <soundtrack> *from my library*"" it would sometimes work. Sometimes.

I’ve had sufficient success with previous generations and thought the latest would be even better. This being the fourth generation and most current, I expected it to be the best. And when I first used it, it performed in very similar fashion but with notably better sound quality. But after a few months I started to experience intermittent connectivity problems. These problems became more frequent and I attempted to seek a replacement from Amazon. However Amazon informed me that the warranty expired after 90 days. In this day and age, a 90 day warranty for an electronic device is unusually short. This will discourage me from making further Amazon echo purchases. My advice for others is to check the warranty so you have a clear understanding of what Amazon will or will not allow as far as seeking replacements for defective items.","Worked at first, but now just a paperweight.",,2.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Charcoal,Configuration: Echo Dot,Tony,Verified Purchase

Looking online shows lots of people having the same problem. But since it's after the 90 day warranty Amazon won't do anything other than give a 15% discount off a new one, probably at the list price.

Now since it seems the Echo dot is so unreliable I'll have to drop the Echo devices too.Review update: 6/17/2021After I first posted this review I received a call from Amazon/Echo tech support, which was only mildly more helpful than previous tech support.One of the first steps was to power cycle the echo dot. Sometimes the device is slow/never completes the boot. The tech support suggested moving it to a different outlet since the ""power may be bad"". That is VERY hard to believe. Even if it is true this difference between outlets would have to be very minor. Either there is a very poor/sensitive design for the original power brick or this is simply a coded way of saying ""try the power cycle again. I've experienced this multiple times: the device won't boot on power cycle but after another power cycle it will boot successfully.The next step was to reset to factory defaults, which had not been done before. This requires holding the action button down until it says ""resetting your device"", which is after the lights go yellow for the first time and the device says ""now in setup mode"".I got a call back after 24 hours to make sure the device was still working, which it was.It failed again later that day.My experience is that a factory reset will allow the device to work for some time over 24 hours but then will fall into the same pattern: the device goes offline and is unusable.  A power cycle will bring it back but not for as long as a factory reset.This looks to me like a serious software problem. The factory reset clears something that over time fills up or corrupts until the device no longer works.So either I constantly power cycle it, do a factory reset every day, or throw it in the trash and use something else.",failing after 90 day warranty,,1.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Twilight Blue,Configuration: Echo Dot,man-with-no-name,Verified Purchase

But, right now, very disappointed.Update: very sensitive microphone! This device will pick up your voice for other rooms! That has its ups and downs. If you have multiple echo devices, it may cause some confusion among them. Also, for tasks that only a “Show” can perform, you will be told just that if the dot picks up the voice command. The echo show seems the more timid introvert of the two echo devices. Unfortunately this causes a problem in my home. So, Dot has been muted, to prevent it from picking up my voice. Very unfortunate.

You must wait some time before you can get it to respond and turn off the devices.  This is especially frustrating if the power failure happens in the middle of the night.

I reset it to factory settings and it worked for about 2 days and then back to nothing.I decided to purchase a Gen 3 because my other one of those has been reliable and I trusted it.

But it has issues which make it the worst Echo in the lineup.The cord is white (even though the unit I bought is black) and is REALLY long.  There's no built-in cord storage so you're on your own there.  But the worst thing about the cord is the plug that goes into the device.  It's no longer a USB cable.  It's something else.

They arrived today and after opening the box, the first thing that I noticed is that the Dot is Black, but the power cord is grey.  Maybe I'm just being anal retentive here, but if I have a black device I want a black power cord!  I think it's weird that the cord and the device are different colors.  Also, the part of the cord that plugs into the wall is much larger than the 3rd generation Dot which is inconvenient.As for the sound quality, the Dot sounds very tinny and no matter how much I play with the equalizer, I can't seem to get the same rich sound I get from my 3rd generation Dots.  I also don't care for the fact that the light ring is under the device so it's hard to see if Alexa heard me or not.Overall, I have to say I'm pretty disappointed with this new device and although I am keeping one of them since it was part of a package deal, I'll probably be sending the other one back and get a 3rd generation one instead.  It's surprising since the difference between the 2nd generation and 3rd generation Dots was so remarkable and it was such an improvement, but this Dot doesn't live up to its predecessors level of advancement when it comes to sound or design.",Sound quality isn't as good as 3rd Gen Dot,,2.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Charcoal,Configuration: Echo Dot,Robert,Verified Purchase

Here's why:1) It sounds like it is a tin can on the end of a string. Horrible. Even for voice only, the previous versions are much better. When I first played it, my wife even asked if Alexa had a new voice. The equalizer in the Alexa app has no effect.  I had transistor radios in the 60's that sounded better.2) Aesthetically, the controls on the ball look funky IMO.  But that is personal preference.  However, they are on the back side (side where power plugs in), so you will have to pick it up to see and use the buttons.3) Why on earth do they include a WHITE power cable for a BLACK device?  And the cord is short.4) Power supply is a standard 15W, but much larger than other 15W units. And it's white.5) Watch out for bait & switch on returns when bought as a bundle.

Like, a night and day difference.  Compared to that massive leap, the difference from 3rd to 4th is very small.  I believe the 4th gen sounds slightly better, but it's very close.This brings us to a weird spot, since the 4th gen is actually larger, which could be a disadvantage for those looking for a compact device.  It's about the same width, but a good bit taller.That being said, I like the new placement of the light ring, and the processing of voice commands is FAR faster (my 3rd gen was taking a few seconds to process).Overall, it's a tiny improvement to a great budget device.  I might replace my 3rd gen + clock with a 4th gen + clock.

I have their Fire Tablet (don’t waste your money), Fire TV Stick, 4 to be exact, 2 Echo Shows, Echo Tower, Echo Dot generations 2-3. I purchased the new Echo Dot 4th generation in excitement, looking for an even better sound quality than the 3rd generation, which is a huge improvement from the 2nd generation. I was expecting the round dome shape of the new speaker to give me a bump in sound quality. As impossible as it may sound, Amazon’s quality worsened. Read the negative reviews, they are accurate. I thought I got a lemon but nope, I got their latest disappointment. The device isn't much bigger than a tennis ball. The sound is tinny as if it were literally coming out of a tin can. I have never had to go into the equalizer and make adjustments, but I did on this device. I adjusted the bass all the way up, the treble all the way down and played with the mid-tones and it still does not compare in the slightest to the sound quality of my Dot 3, which I’ve never had to adjust. I went to setup my new Dot 4 device and discovered they had shortened the cord by about 12” now limiting where the device can be placed. The cord quality has suffered severely, not just in length but also in its cheap design. If you are solely purchasing this Dot to talk to Alexa and ask her questions and you are never going to listen to music, this may be fine for you. But I especially purchased this in expectations of a fuller sound experience. After setting this up and manipulating it to try to make it better, I went to Amazon to see what others were saying. To my chagrin I noticed that Amazon released two different 4th generation Dots, one with subpar sound and if you want to pay almost $100, you can purchase it with premium sound. Tell me who does not want premium sound? Just another gimmick to steal our money. I honestly cannot image that the more expensive Dot 4 with premium sound has a grander sound quality than the Dot 3 that would entice me to spend an extra $40 (on sale). I am sending it back and will purchase the Echo Dot with Premium Sound just to see if there is a difference, if not it will be going back as well.

I enjoy it so much I decided to buy a second , without clock , to make a stereo effect when using Alexa for music. Little did I know I can incorporate my full size Echo to enhance the bass , like is a sub woofer. Does it rattle the windows ? No. Does it sound very nice ? YesAbout this particular Dot . I got black  because of where it'll be located so it would basically disappear but if you're not trying to hide one the other colors are really nice as well. The white isn't bright white but isn't bordering cream either. I really liked the sky blue color of my first one (until I discovered a black Sharpie worked well to make it black while not blocking out the clock ) so it's a nice way to go as well. My last full size Echo was the blue and it is a nice color choice for just about any color scheme room , unlike the white and black that can really become an unwanted drawing of the eyes point  but I digress.The buttons on the unit are easy to find and work well . Set up was darn near automatic , much much better than Echo devices just a year ago.The volume can easily fill a room by itself but at a cost of sound quality if its trying to do things by itself. For a large room a big brother Echo will have a lot more oomph and punch whether music or vocal . This Dot will work but sound cheap and Tinny at higher volumes . The 3rd gen Dot doesn't get as loud as this one but was really a little too much in my daughters bedroom when she set it above 5 (50% volume ) . For that size room the 2nd gen Dot was just right. She has a smaller (15'x 15' ) room by far than my 28'x30' den .This one , just like the other 4th gen devices have the microphones near the volume buttons and work very well unless trying to compete with my sound bar they sit on top of . Then they just ignore my attempts to talk with Alexa. At that point I can just talk to the full size Echo by my sofa (across the room ) . You ask any smart device to discern my voice from a tv voice when the tv is inches away and I'm yards away isn't fair so I won't give it a knock but when the sound bar isn't on the Dot can hear me easily even if I speak just above a whisper and the one closest to my den door can hear commands when I first enter the house so by the time I get to the den my lights are lit and I can have music playing if I so choose . Alexa software has really come a long way in 2020 from clunky and not able to discern me from my dog to being able to understand what my 4 year old granddaughter is trying to get to happen and myself practically having a 2 way conversation with it.Catching it on sale and using the interest free 5 payment plan made this one an easy choice that is very budget friendly. The only Echo device cheaper is the Flex but I'd recommend that one only for using Alexa features and routines. The sound and volume on it are not room filling and rich at all . Fine for voice searches and such but not so much even for audio books. For that the Dot more than suffices .If I had to choose 1 Echo device and only 1 it'd be a Dot for it's value and usability . Since I could choose more than 1 ,my most used is the full size 4th gen Echo but I really like the new Dots shape , sound quality , light bar on the bottom , button user friendliness and color choices  .If you want a great value , don't need a clock and oomph in your music /audio books listening isn't a must you can't go wrong with this one unless you don't like a device the size of a baseball sitting on your furniture  or shelf .",Got It For Setting Up Stereo  But Really Like It By Itself As Well.,Top Contributor: Sunglasses,5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Charcoal,Configuration: Echo Dot,Stephen Elmore,Verified Purchase

The halo light is now at the base of the echo dot which is not as noticeable as the halo light on the previous echo devices in most instances. We set ours up on a low glass surface now so it's more noticeable but when it was onto of the fridge we couldn't see it light up not even on the cabinets above the fridge. For us it can only be placed in one location to satisfy our needs but that's ok because it's a great color addition to our livingroom. As with all echo devices it's a great voice command speaker. They still have not perfected the microphone as it still has difficulty understanding us while the Google devices have no trouble understanding us and the search results are better with Google devices too. Alexa is a much easier to setup and use smart home/home automation platform than Google so we're definitely staying with Amazon Alexa with hopes that they'll improve the voice recognition.

,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2022","Alexa has become an integral part of our family, even if not the only or even the most used voice assistant. Anyway, I added the dot only because I wanted a cheap way to expand it to more rooms.At $50 it’s a great alternative, also because it adds features that non-Amazon devices currently don’t offer. One of those is the ability to control the Echo wall clock, not essential but a nice touch that only works with Echo devices.Setup is easy in a way that’s simply expected today. In this case, it involves a smartphone with the Alexa app. If this is not your first Alexa device, adding a second or third is very easy.The diminutive size may not have you expect great sound, and while audiophiles may snuff at it, the sound quality is great for voice and good for music. The bass is present but don’t expect it to rock your world.Microphone and subsequent voice recognition are good. PF course you get all Alexa functionality and a few that non Alexa devices don’t get. For instance, using a collection of Alexa speakers to announce dinner (all speakers broadcasting) works, but only if initiated from the echo. Non-Amazon devices on the same network are only recipients.Another issue is a fundamental one with Alexa. Unlike it’s colleagues from the other ecosystems, Alexa cannot think in 24hr format time. You can configure the displayed time on applicable devices, but the voice assistant simply cannot be configured to use anything other than the old fashioned AM/PM.

3 people found this helpful,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2020","I actually like the spherical design of the New Echo Dot. It fits well almost anywhere. It is simplistic and the fabric-like material makes it look a bit more classy. The buttons do cheapen the design a bit but that can be overlooked. I do not understand why the charcoal version comes with a white power cord (cut costs?), but it does limit where it can be placed. If you are already in the Amazon ecosystem, setting it up is a breeze. If not, then there's some paying around to be done with the mobile app.The Echo Dot works just as well as its full-size sisters. It recognizes my commands consistently, albeit sometimes does not address the actual question (but that's more on Amazon's engine, though). I am still trying to figure out how to work 3 echos together -just weird that I cannot do that straight out of the box.My biggest complaint is the sound. My my, I was blown away by how bad it is! I mean, it sounds almost as bad as my phone's speakers. There is no bass at all. Everything sounds tinny and hollow. Even if it is loud, having no bass makes listening to music a futile activity. Even the occasional audiobook or podcast makes me want to take out my phone instead.The reason why I did not give it a lower score is that I bought it for only $18, which is actually a good deal if you are looking for an introduction to a Home Assistant experience. Or, if you just want something for the kid's room. If I didn't already own other Echo devices, which are much better, and this was my first, it would drive me to look elsewhere.",Nice design.

,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2022","I have recently added an Echo (3rd Gen. charcoal (2018)) Dot, an Echo (4th Gen. charcoal ((2020) Dot, two Echo (4th Gen. glacier white) Dots, and an Echo (4th Gen. glacier white) Dot with clock. I will be posting this same review for all of those. Some have remarked that they believe the 3rd generation dots have audio superior to the 4th generation ones. It seems to me the sound is better in the 4th generation units, however my hearing isn't great and the placement of the the 3rd generation one isn't very good (it's in the garage). I did discover that the sound quality and volume of the 4th generation one in a bathroom was significantly deeper and richer and noticeably louder when I moved it from being backed up against a single wall to being in a corner. It is on a stone vanity top at the corner of two sheetrock walls. These three hard surfaces seem to be acting like a megaphone for the audio - it sounds very good now. In all other respects there doesn't seem to be much difference in the performance or response of the four units except for the 4th generation with the clock almost seems bothered by me and intentionally ignoring it's wake word. I haven't determined if the difference is due to placement, it having to tell time as well, or the personality of the individual device; but it definitely seems to have an attitude. Some users have complained of the clock being too dim, but I find it to be ok - slightly brighter would be nicer, but no problem. They all seem to understand both my wife and me very well (and I've even used quite a few local expressions to speak to them with no problems). One complaint I have is that if I have the volume set for listening to pleasant listening music, Alexa's voice is too low to be easily understood. There should be different volume settings, and if there are already I haven't discovered how to handle that yet.",All that I have are working great,,5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Charcoal,Configuration: Echo Dot,A Constant Reader,Verified Purchase

I brought the third, newest to my condo in Florida for the winter (as I had previously with my second).  So far, so good, no problems.  Echo Dot was on sale:  I'll buy a second one for my condo (Echo Dot #4), they are so great!  Arrived yesterday and was almost too easy to set up.  Alexa did not ask me no to use app to set it up.  Problems began. Started playing news and music back at my home in the north.  I know bc my spouse would call me to complain that the Echo Dots in Main House were playing as well as Sonos speakers.  Newest Echo Dot was not playing in Snowbird Condo even though command issued from it.  Re-booted, seemed to fix it for awhile.  Then problem migrated to Echo Dot 3 (brought south from Main House) and would not play NPR here.  It played it up north to disturb my spouse.  Spent a lot of time trouble-shooting, thought it was fixed.  And then it still would not play NPR station (from home town) in condo, only in Main House even though command issued from Snowbird Condo.  I tried to get rid of groups, etc. but this is getting absurd.  I fear disturbing my spouse up north, can't get the news down here and wasting a lot of time.  Some new software upgrades have made Alexa too smart for me and it looks like too smart for Alexa.  Since last sentence I spent more time dickering with settings within the app, rebooting (press the button unrelated to volume on top) to reconfigure.

,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2021","PROS:+ Faster response than my older Dots+ Better microphone than my older Dots+ Sound quality as good or better than my older Dots+ I love using these for streaming music and control my Kasa products+ I like the available emergency features (more on this in my review)CONS:- The lights on the bottom are hard to see from a distance- Amazon is starting to annoy me with new features I don't want- Using these as intercoms has never worked for me.  The sound quality (volume) has always been too low to be usable- ""dropping in"" has never worked well either due to poor audio quality- I have never been able to create a group of these for multi-room audio because they can't handle enterprise grade wifi (where more than one WAP has the same SSID and uses multiple bands)- Privacy will always be a concern with these units.  Who is listening?Review:I now have at least 15 dots.  I have everything from the first generation to this latest 4th generation in use.  I think for me, the 3rd gen devices are a better design.  The lights on these 4th gen devices are on the bottom and are hard to see from across the room.  On the 3rd gen the lights are on the top and much easier to see.  Otherwise they are mostly the same at the moment.  As time goes on the 3rd gen units will no doubt become slower by design just like my 1st and 2nd gen units are now.My primary uses are control of my smart switches (Kasa) and to listen to music (DeadLive skill).  I also like the integration with my Weather station (Ambient Weather) and the ability to make announcements across all the devices (like when dinner is ready).  I also find the unit in the kitchen gets used to set timers for everything all the time.Another use that is not immediately obvious is the use of these units for elder care.  Let me explain how i have used them.  I have an elderly mother who lives by herself.  I purchased a Show and a Dot for her apartment and connected them to my account.  The Show device is in her kitchen and the way I have it setup I can see the kitchen and her recliner from the built in camera.  The Dot is in her bathroom.  If she is not answering the phone or emails I can use the app on my phone to ""drop in"" on the Show unit and view the camera to see if she is in the kitchen or watching TV with her headphones on.  Of course she knows about this setup and is OK with it.  I can talk to her via the Show device or the Dot using the APP on my phone when I want to check to see if she is OK.  Also, if she needs to contact me or 911 during an emergency she can do so with her devices.  So if she were to slip in the bathroom or have a problem in the kitchen she can call 911 with the help of Alexa.  It should also be noted that you must correctly set the physical address of the devices in the Alexa app if you want this to work as intended.  I feel much better knowing that she has this system available to her.  A friend of hers fell and broke a hip and was alone in her apartment for 3 days on the floor unable to get up before she finally remember she could call her daughter using the Alexa device she had.  Doing so saved her life.  That's what gave me the idea to set this up for my mom.Aside from the above, there is the issue of the new features being introduced by Amazon that are becoming more annoying.  One example of this is the unit waking me up to ask me if I want to write a product review for something I purchased.  That is just a terrible idea.  If I want to write a review, I will do so on my own.  I don't need Alexa waking me up on a Saturday morning asking me about it.

,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2021","I hate this product, but at the same time could not find anything to replace it.I didn't want Alexa in the first place, but thought at a 50% discount, Echo Dot would make a decent Bluetooth speaker.Well, the product has such a terrible flaw that I could not bear using it, despite its quite good sound quality.UNRELIABLE CONNECTIONSIt drops the connection frequently! Multiple times it threw me into a frenzy during an online meeting because the computer did not have sound!  I know how to quickly switch audio sources. But problem is that the speaker would just disappear while the computer is on. It would drop connection altogether. The only thing I could do is to restart the computer. Although it fixes the problem usually, it creates a terrible amount of stress when you are in an important meeting. And I know the problem is caused by Echo because the computer has never had any audio problems.Just one incidents like that makes you wish that you had never bought this thing, but had instead invested on a straight USB or Bluetooth speaker.UNBEARABLE ALEXADespite its having Bluetooth, it cannot be simply set up as a Bluetooth speaker, as it requires Wi-Fi based connection and set up.  Merely connecting as a Bluetooth speaker will not work, and the speaker will be forever stuck in the setup mode, waiting for the Wi-Fi-based set up in order to have Alexa. Therefore, you can't use Echo without Alexa.Also, because Echo must be first connected with the home network through the Wi-Fi, it is not easy to do the initial set up, far trickier than the ordinary USB speaker or straight Bluetooth speaker. I had to look at the instructions in order to do it.And I'll tell you how Alexa makes Echo even harder to live with.I knew I didn't want Alexa from the very beginning, so the first thing I did was to try to mute everything that could be muted or silenced. But still, every time when it connects to the computer, it makes that pretentious, almost obnoxious announcement. Sometimes it even makes a loud announcement with no reason except to startle you.  It happens frequently in occasions when you absolutely don't expect that thing to make a sudden loud noise to interrupt, or even to startle everyone nearby.And this is when the speaker is switched to ""silent"" mode in the settings!A speaker just needs be a speaker when needed and shot up when it is not!  All the ""tech"" pretensions are nothing but annoyance.Overall, even if it didn't do that obnoxious loud noise, the existence of Alexa does not only add any value, but in fact makes it creepy and uncomfortable to use.  Even though I really don't mind the privacy issue (I'm not sure if that really is an issue), I still find it very annoying for all unwanted noisy announcements the speaker makes.POOR USER INTERFACEAnother thing I don't like is the control buttons.  It is an awkward superficial gimmicky design. To turn the volume down or up, you have to press the soft button numerous times with all the incessant peeps when your click. Old-fashioned mechanical volume slider control would do it silently and elegantly within a second. What Amazon has is foolish gimmicky consumerism design with no consideration of actual utility. This is typical sacrificing the utility for vanity (actually worse than that, because it does not even have a good appearance).THE LACK OF OTHER COMMON FEATURESAlso Echo doesn't have backup battery and USB-C charging, making it inferior to USB Bluetooth speakers there have such features.  Just mentioning. I didn't even consider it a big problem.BUTBut this thing actually sounds very good.In fact, because the Echo's sound quality is so good, it's not easy to find a replacement.  I thought a dedicated Bluetooth speaker at a comparable price would outperform Echo Dot, so I tried Anker Soundcore Mini 3 which has very good reviews, but was shocked by how poor Anker's sound quality is compared to Echo Dot.  The sound of Echo Dot is solid, clear and natural. Anker is hollow, distorted and unnaturalI went back to Echo, but I still hate it, and will continue to look for a replacement.  As it already passed the return period, the only thing I could do is to throw it away when I find a good substitute.  What a pity, because the quality of its sound is really quite good.UPDATE:Bought a JBL Clip 3 intending to replace Echo Dot with it.  What a mistake!  JBL isunusable for a simple reason:  it never maintains a connection with a Windows 10 PC, which is what I intend to use it with. Every 10 minutes, it automatically turns off. That's OK, if it can manage to reconnect automatically next time when it is used. But it cannot. Every time after it has automatically turned off, it will require a manual re-connection. And it is not just a one-click kind of reconnection. It's a multistep reconnection very much like the initial pairing.  Completely unusable.I didn't try it with a mobile device, so I don't know about if it will automatically reconnect there. But with Windows 10 PC, forget it.In addition, it shares the same gimmicky and inconvenient volume control. I guess that's where the world has gone.To the credit of JBL, it does have comparable sound quality. And it has a 10-hour battery, meaning it is truly wireless in regular operation (in contrast, Echo has to be constantly powered, therefore even though it's Bluetooth, it always has an AC adapter connected, making it much messier). JBL is also much smaller, which is a good thing considering that the sound quality is about the same (because usually it is harder to make a smaller speak to sound good - basic acoustics).  But all these benefits don't matter when it could not maintain a connection.But the bottom line is that I'm still stuck with Alexa.","Good sound quality, but overall a terrible product - bad user interface, terrible Alexa",,1.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Charcoal,Configuration: Echo Dot,Gao Atamazon,Verified Purchase

Which is terrific for music playing but not so good when listening to other human voices (podcast, talk radio) as the bass are too strong when in “neutral” position. And modulating the bass is problematic when the voice command sound is sooooo loud (back to issue #1).Extra drawback/suggestion for upgrade:• It should be wireless!!!!! We can’t move it around.

,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2021","We bought this Alexa dot just after Christmas and set it up fairly easily.  However, when we needed to unplug it or move it, it became annoying as it needed to be reconnected to the internet each time.  After a couple months, the device would need to be connected to the internet more and more frequently (without even unplugging the device as a catalyst).Also, she would frequently misunderstand our questions and answer us with completely unrelated information.  A few times the device would show a 'notification color' light and when we asked about our notifications or messages, she would say there were none.  Okay..?My husband used the device mostly as a timer and it would work maybe 90% of the time.  Sometimes it would act like he never even set up a timer.  He stopped using the device after relying on it to set an alarm timer to remind him to get ready for work and it never went off.We spent several hours troubleshooting over the last few months and on virtual chat with customer service/tech support, but the same issues kept recurring.  They informed us that the warranty is only 90 days, which I didn't know about because I hadn't read the fine print (the more expensive Amazon devices have a 1-year warranty, but THIS device only 90 days).  They offered us a 20% discount on a new Amazon device after failing to fix this one... yah, we'll pass on buying another faulty device.So, after researching, we bought a Google Nest Mini this month and are SUPER pleased with it.  It is like the Amazon Dot but far better in every way:  set-up was in seconds, Wifi was automatically connected using our phone's Wifi info, we didn't have to reset the Wifi when moved to a different room, reliable timers/notifications, and a more concise and intuitive AI that understands our prompts better.  Bonus:  less time yelling ""shut up Alexa!"" ""Alexa, STOP"" ""NO, we don't want you to purchase that for us, Alexa"".  We would turn into very angry people every time we had to interact with her, which is not like us.

I was looking for an alternative to using bluetooth speakers coupled to my phone to play steaming music and I got this on special at $39.95.It far exceeded my expectations. Alexa hears wayyy better than Siri and has more capabilities. The sound quality is much better than the Bluetooth Speakers I had been using. Not as good as a real stereo with a decent set of speakers, but for a softball sized device, the sound is good enough for a kitchen, bedroom, etc.  The bass and treble during playback is decent, but the mid-tones are slightly muddy.

Other reviewers have said the Gen 3 sounds better than the Gen 4, some say the exact opposite, but to me they sound EXACTLY the same. And why wouldn't they? The both have the same speaker.

I figured the audio ought to be better on the dots as well since they have a similar build. I WAS WRONG.

I even changed the bass, mid, and treble settings in the app. I'm not much of a fan of the audio on the Echo Show 5s (they start to crackle after a while), but those honestly sound better than the 4th Gen Echo Dot.

Bought this as my attempt at using voice to automate activities. Initial setup seemed almost too easy and it was.

Although, you can use third party tools to determine the devices IP address, router status, router strength and hardware configurations, Alexa does not seem to have a voice response/tool for system status.Volume and/or sound is surprisingly good. If you find a spot that has some audio reflective properties (corner) you can enhance the quality. It also easily pairs/syncs with bluetooth stereos (and your phone).The Device can be unplugged and then re-plugged in and quickly syncs with your router if in range. My router is in the living room and I can go out to the RV (70 ft?) and Alexa will sync/work. Biggest complaints are no feedback for system status and the device seems a little delicate and difficult to clean. The surface of the sphere is mostly covered with a semi-durable cloth-like net.

We had a 5 inch Show on the kitchen peninsula (separates the kitchen and great room).  It replaced a 2nd generation Dot, which we moved to another location.Having the visual element was nice but we found the Show was horrible at hearing the wake word unless you were standing directly in front of it. Makes sense for a device with a screen, I guess; there's a presumption that you'll be standing in front of it to see the display.So we decided to move the Show to the entry hall, up against a wall, where we could have it display the Cloudcam and Ring cameras, and get a  Dot that we thought would be more omnidirectional. In fact, our older Dots were very good at picking up the wake word from the side or behind, with the round shape. We liked the spherical look of the latest generation so we ordered this. It was our first 4th gen Dot.I paid the extra $2.99 for same day delivery and eagerly awaited its arrival. It was supposed to come between 2 and 6 pm.

Maybe I somehow clicked the wrong box in the process of redoing the order. The blue color didn't go with the kitchen decor at all and looked odd and out of place.But that's not all. Sadly, it proved to be almost as bad at hearing the wake word, even when we spoke very loudly, as the Show. I ended up switching it out with the 3rd gen charcoal colored Dot that was in the upstairs bathroom, which is the only room in the house with a blue color theme. That worked out okay since the 3rd gen is WAY better at hearing from different directions, but it's sort of sad that the cool-shaped 4th gen model had to be relegated to a guest bathroom that's rarely used.I do have to say, though, that its speaker is great - the sound is very rich and full.

Just looking at box for the Charcoal and the picture does show a white cord, we need to study product pictures much, much better I guess. I kind of feel like I shopped at a bargain basement store.Amazon one more thing - why are you registering the Echo devices when purchased?  My Charcoal would not set up. App showed 2 new Echo Dots, but offline.  Plugged 1st one in, it had a green ring?  Held down the button, stayed green. Unplugged several times, took a tea break and still didn't go into set up mode.  Double checked the box for instructions, none.  Searched help regarding the ""Green"" ring?  ""Oh!"" internet says Amazon added more help & colors.  Guess what I had some sort of notification.  I guess that is why I couldn't get the setup mode.  Went into the Alex app and derigestered it.  Sure enough now I could setup it up.  Plugged in my 2nd new Dot bingo no green ring or problems.  Setup immediately. AND I had not cleared my notificiations yet.So my last question deals with Christmas gifts.  I bought 4 Echo Flex devices & bulbs for my neighbors.  Thought they could use them in their garages or wherever like I'm going to do.  I haven't received them yet but they are listed in my Echo Devices.  Now do I need to open the boxes and deregister them before I wrap them?",Some things changing - Is Amazon now a bargain basement store?,,5.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Charcoal,Configuration: Echo Dot,MT,Verified Purchase
,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2021","Fortunately, the one I've gotten was through a perk system in my workplace and I didn't pay a cent to get it.This is horrible. I've got a 2nd generation echo that has been dropped onto pavement ground several times between moves over the course of a few years, and even that has better hearing than this one does.THIS one takes about 40 minutes of repeatedly putting in the same wifi password before it decides to connect. I checked the wifi settings on my router directly, confirmed the password, and even went as far as a factory reset or two on the router. It just connects when it feels like it.It worked great for a day or so and ignored about 20% of what I'd say, but it's a machine and makes mistakes, and my old echo has about the same rate of success. No big deal.Two days later, it interprets ""volume 3"" as ""turn it all the way up"" and ""my restaurant vibes playlist"" as ""random heavy metal station"". I love metal, but that's not even related to what I said. There isn't even any way to mistake that terminology with a deaf person over the phone.I have absolutely nothing positive to say about this.

The Amazon dot, gets confused about 40% of the times, this never happened with the Google Nest.  After 6 months of use, Alexa goes silent (no light) and the only way to fix this is to unplug and re-plug the device.  I have been patiently doing this, hoping the issue was going to fix on its own but for the last two month the issue is occurring more and more often and I now need to unplug/re-plug the device about every 2-3 days.  Another issue with the device is I usually have it at a low volume to listen to my tv (line in) and during the day I raise the volume but at the same time, Alexa’s volume is raised so when I say a command, Alexa is extremely loud.  I wish Alexa’s volume was separate to avoid this. Now let’s talk about warranty coverage...  It's unbelievably painful to find and get to warranty support for this device.  Once I found the link to chat, I was on a chat troubleshooting for about 2 hours.  At the end that the agent decided to process the warranty, she wanted me to ship the item first to Amazon, wait a few days for them to process it and then send me the replacement.  The agent then told me she couldn't process it and asked me to delete my home address and re-enter (to check, if that was going to allow her to process the request).

The base lights are hard to see especially if you have it on a wall mount so you can't visually see if it heard you. i tried using it in 2 rooms and the sound was poor in both and the microphone was just as bad in both.

It sounds like a cheap speaker. The 3rd gen dot on the other hand has quite impressive full sound for its size. Sure they aren't a substitute for a true home sound system, but for everyday listening they are pretty good. So I don't know what went wrong with this new one. It's just not even close. The design is also odd. The sphere means the ring lights are at the bottom where you can't see them. The buttons poke through the fabric on the top and feel cheap. Unlike the unassuming disk shape of the previous generation, this sphere is obvious and obtrusive.If you are considering upgrading from the gen 2, this is an ok buy.

,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2021","Alexa is getting better. But it doesn't matter which device you use to communicate with Alexa, unless your task needs a screen. Whether you use an Echo Flex that you got on sale for $9.99 to the top of the line Echo device, voice commands will be processed the same way.  So what you are really paying for is sound quality, and the device falls short.It's easy to find a selection of computer speakers and sound bars in the $30 to $50 range, and they sound far better than this Echo Dot.  You should expect that an Echo Show at $50 would have at least the quality of better speakers at the low end of that price range. But it doesn't come close. Adding the other features shouldn't raise the price more than that of a low end Echo device, considering that only a fraction of what's in it would be needed.If you want to listen to music and aren't expecting high end sound, you won't get that. But you won't get low end sound bar quality either. The sound quality is good enough for Alexa's voice, but not really good enough for music, and far worse than you'd expect for the money.The device also supports Bluetooth, including BLE, and that's where the frustration started. I tried pairing a Sengled bulb to it and had no end of trouble. It didn't work reliably.  I initially thought it was the bulb, but when I replaced the bulb, it worked initially and after a few days I was back to the same problems. Communication was intermittent, and when I started the pairing process again, it worked -- only this time, the bulb paired with a different Echo device on a different floor in the house at the other end of the house. It worked perfectly that way.It seemed pretty clear that the Bluetooth in this device is defective, and after doing a factory reset and trying the pairing process again, I had the same problems. Unplugging this device and having the bulb pair with a remotely located Echo Show fixed that issue and it's been working perfectly 100% of the time.I have other Echo devices so I have a workaround, but there's no reason that I shouldn't be able to pair a bulb with an Echo Dot that's five feet away. I tried contacting Amazon through chat, and they gave me the runaround until I finally gave up. Trying everything they said did nothing, and they clearly seemed more interested in getting me to go away than to admit that their product is defective.",Less than mediocre sound and Amazon doesn't stand behind it,,2.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Glacier White,Configuration: Echo Dot,Wayne,Verified Purchase
,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2021","Update May 2021:  Now when I call, they tell me they can’t see that I’ve reset the device when I’m fast I am having to reset the device every other day if not daily. Giving a device like this a 90 day warranty is very telling. They are aware of its potential early failure modes, and they are trying to push consumers to buy the extended warranties. Please just take mine back and let me get one that works so my child can listen to his music at night to sleep. Is it really that expensive to support?I’ve now contacted support four times in one week. The most recent before tonight suggested I needed to contact support when the device was actively having an issue. So I did that tonight. I was asked to move the device within 5 m of a router, done! Ah that doesn’t help me with where it’s supposed to go. Now they offer a 15% discount on a new one since This one is out of warranty. 4 echos in the house, including a gen 1 echo and three dots, and this 4th gen dot has been having issues off and in since February. Support is not very helpful. Back to playing music for our child via Bluetooth.The problematic one has started not responding. I've been unplugging it and plugging it back in, and then it works.  So this happens every few days.  I contacted support and of course the warranty period ended April 1st. Their only suggestion was to reset the device, which is what I have had to do twice now since I called in.  Last night it became unresponsive after it heard the wake word, the blue light just stayed on, so I reset it.  It looks like I will have to constantly reset it to keep it working, which is extremely frustrating.  The good one has been working great, still, since day one.So I’ll average my rating at a solid 3. We bought two for our boys. One has worked great since set up, the other has required resetting three times since Christmas. So I’ll review the problematic one. Both set up just fine, nice and easy as expected and they both integrated with our other echos and compatible smart devices. One day while scanning my network I noticed a device that I didn’t recognize. I did an online search and figured out that what I was seeing was the wireless component of one of the new echo devices we had just given our children for Christmas. While all the other echos attached to out network were identified as amazon devices. Hmm, not a huge deal. I unplugged it and reset it. Fast forward a few weeks and one night while asking the echo to run the same routine we run every night at bedtime, it tells me that it appears I am trying to control a device that is linked to another account, would you like me to control it?  Well of course!!  Well that didn’t work. I had to deregister the echo and set it up from scratch again. All good......until a few weeks later. Same bedtime routine and the echo is telling us it can’t play music from pandora, that we need to enable the skill and that it had sent us instructions on how to do so, despite being registered to an account that has three other echo devices that can play stations from my Pandora without any issues. So another deregister and setup from scratch and it’s working just fine, for now. I contacted support at one point, but they want to troubleshoot in real time. This occurs during the bedtime of my 6 year old, I don’t have time to troubleshoot at that time. I realize these devices aren’t perfect, but my son thinks he has a bad one, and I’m getting frustrated. I’m not quite sure what to do at this point. The “bad” one and the “good” one are both equal distance from the router. I don’t quite understand what I can do different.

I like the button on top to turn off listening. It only responded once so far out of context when we did not use the wake word and it just misunderstood one of our words to be a wake word and so started answering to its best ability to whatever it heard for the remainder of our conversation. I do not care for the wordy responses when it cannot complete a task I have given it. The kids enjoy having conversations with it which is not something I find entertaining.

BTW, the placement is only 20 feet from my AC router that is rated at 100 Mbps and gets a consistent 30 Mbps at its weakest.

,"Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2021","Comparing this to the Echo Dot v3 (the last puck-shaped model):There is very slightly more bass, which is nice, and the speaker is more directional (i.e. it comes from a certain side of the sphere, so you can point it in a particular direction, as opposed to the v3, which emanates from all sides at once), and that is a plus, because it is a bit easier to understand the Alexa voice (provided you are located in the direction that the speaker is pointed).However, the internal microphone appears to be much less sensitive than the one in the v3, so I am finding I have to speak much louder than I did with the v3 for it to even register that I’m speaking at all. I find this to be a major downfall — with the v3, it was remarkable how if it was anywhere in the same room, I could just speak at a normal volume, and it seemed to always hear me. With this v4, I have to raise my voice to almost a yell, even when I’m only a few feet away.In my opinion, other than the pleasing spherical shape, the slightly stronger bass and slightly better intelligibility of the Alexa voice, I see almost no reason to favor this over the v3. And if I understand correctly from reading about both, I don’t even think there’s any added functionality with the v4 over the v3 (feel free to correct me if I’m wrong about that).I bought this at a good discount during Prime weekend, but if the discounts on both v3 and v4 were still in place, I would exchange this for another v3 in a heartbeat.","Feels like a downgrade from the v3 model, in several important respects",,3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Twilight Blue,Configuration: Echo Dot,cmosco,Verified Purchase
,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2021","I bought my first Echo Dot when it was Gen 2. I've seen that with each new generation that comes out, the microphone quality get worse and Alexa has a harder and harder time understanding us. Our Gen 2 can hear us better and from farther away than the Gen 3s that are closer, and the same is true of the Gen 3s outperforming the Gen 4.With that said, the sound quality has improved with each generation. But we hardly ever use the Echo Dots for music, just announcements and to control smart devices—both of which are aggravated by the poorer hearing of the newer Echo Dots. Hence our frustration with the new Gen 4. We want an Echo Dot that hears us well, but we can't buy a Gen 2 anymore.So what'd we do? It's a shame, but we put this in a place where we don't speak to it often, but want it to send out announcements in our house. We'd bought it to upgrade and replace our Gen 3 in the kitchen, but replaced it with the Gen 3 again after a week of frustration.If you use your Echo Dot as a speaker, this is the best Dot you can get.

But I use this in the bathroom and it does just fine. And a good thing is they finally made the + and - volume keys raised so that I can feel the difference and select the one I want. I have found that asking alexa to turn down the volume often happens in too large of an increment, so adjusting by hand is better since I can feel which button is which.What I don't like about the unit is that the body of the dot (the ball) is black and the power cord is white. On a bathroom counter that is very obvious. I found this ridiculous and unexpected that they couldn't provide a black cord with a black unit. I ended up spray painting my power cord black. Grumble grumble.The 2nd thing I don't like is that there is no audio or aux in. I have a cd player that I use to play some older cds. And there is no aux in on this dot, and there isn't one on an echo show that I have in the kitchen. the only way to connect the cd player is blue tooth. Well if I want to connect the cd player using bluetooth to my dot in the bathroom I have to unpair the cd player from the echo show in the kitchen and create a new pairing on the one in the bathroom and vice versa. If I don't do this the blue tooth cd player plays on a dot/echo in the wrong room! This gets old very fast. :(  Grumble Grumble. I can't believe it is that hard to add an aux in on these units.Finally a negative, is that I refuse to buy a small echo show, just so that I can see what time it is. So if I want to see the time, I have to have a clock near by. Clock radios may be a thing of the past, but the concept is very functional.

,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2021","I really like my Echo Dot 4th gen. My granddaughters also enjoy using it. One thing that I especially like is that by using the app I can control the amount of treble and bass on the Echo.  However, there are a few things I don't like but maybe some of these could be controlled in the settings if I just knew more about what I was doing. The main reason I purchase the Echo was to use it as a speaker for my desktop computer.  It does have a good sound to it. But sometimes when I am playing a video and I click on the pause button after a few seconds the Echo starts playing the video again without any input from me. And it keeps doing that no matter how many times I click the pause button. Another thing I find annoying is that it always announces when it is starting back up as a speaker after it  has been off for a while. ""Now playing to desktop (followed by computer ID).""  A third thing is that as long as the speaker is enabled it won't let my computer go into sleep mode.  I can fix this problem and the pause problem by just disabling the speaker when I'm not actually using it, but it is annoying to have to disable and enable it so many times in one day.  Having said all of that I still like it a lot and will probably buy another one at some point to pair with this one.

Or they designed it worse on purpose so you'd buy more of them.I have a Google Home programmed with a routine that talks to my Echo Dot 3rd gen. I replaced that Echo dot with this 4th gen and put it in exactly the same spot.The Echo went from responding 100% of the time to about 2% of the time.

Unfortunately, this unit is very slow to respond to my voice commands-I have to repeat my commands several times, and I practically have to yell at it in order for it to hear me.Also, the textured covering is a dust magnet-it's hard to keep clean, and I have 3 cats, so pet hair is drawn to it. The indicator light is too hard to see, so even with the vast improvement in sound, I only was able to add one more star.**Original Review*Hubby gifted me this dot for Xmas, and I was planning on upgrading my bedroom unit with this one and putting the old one in the bathroom. When I plugged in the new unit, I was disappointed with the thin sound quality- it sounded like one of those cheap off brand speakers you'd get at Walgreens for $5. No bass even after maxing it out in the app and putting it in a semi enclosed space that amplifies the sound. I listen to a lot of electronic music-dub techno in particular uses lots of sounds in the lower end of the audio spectrum, and on this unit they are barely audible. On my 3rd gen, the bass is full, rolling and impressive...I am very pleased with my older unit, so it's staying in my room while the new one will be relegated to the bathroom, where I will be using it to listen to news when I get ready for work.I also noticed some connection issues-I have the new and old units connected so I can go from one room to the other and have the same channel on- I can tell the bedroom unit to play a specific channel and it plays in the bedroom but the one in the bath won't respond unless I go in there and talk to it directly. Maybe I have to control it from the app. Also, if I do get it to play, it disconnects and shuts off on its own randomly.

The 4th gen take up more vertical space and they stick out a bit too much. The cloth covering is everywhere on these so you can expect them to get dirty from touching more often. The sound is more direction as the speaker seems tilted towards the front. But it doesn’t result in a better sound overall. The 3rd sends the sound upwards and outwards which fills the room better. The bass on the 3rd gen is much more present. I used the same songs at the same levels aim the same spot in my house and the 3rd gen dot worked better. If your room is very reflective sound wise then yeah it’ll disperse a lot. The 4th gen tightens up the sound in that regard but you miss the bass. Even when turned up to compensate, it didn’t really deliver. Something about needing that contact and angle to transmit bass frequencies better that it doesn’t have. It’s a good device. It does everything well. But it’s not a great improvement over the 3rd gens. I bought six of those already and they are still better for the price. Maybe the 4th gen edges it out when it comes to speaking voices like Alexa’s. But that’s it. If they discontinue the 3rd then yes definitely get this.

To understand my rating I will first tell you how I use the device. This device is in my bedroom and connected to a portable speaker 100% of the time. Most of the features of the device come from the fact that it  is connected and thus are available across all of the generations, so this is all the same. The speaker quality I will not rate because I don't use that. What I will rate are the connection quality to the portable speaker and the devices ability to recognize me activating it.The connection to the portable speaker is much improved over the Gen 1 in that it only requires a reset about once a month. You can tell when a reset is needed as it will have a slight dead air moment. The Gen 1 needed a reset about once every 10 days.The Gen 4 falls far behind the Gen 1 in ability to recognize when it is being activated. I have done the voice training several times at this point and it still has trouble. The Gen 1 device has been moved to another room and it picks up on it's name quickly and reliably but the Gen 4 requires me to many times call out to it several times. Given that this is the most important feature of the device it gets the most weight and thus 2 stars overall.Update: After posting this Amazon support got in touch with me about the poor response I am getting from the Gen 4. Since running through trouble shooting with them the issue has been cleared up and the response is much better. The issue is that with this model if you change the wake-up name you need to unplug the device for 30 seconds right away (this doesn't need to be done with older devices).

I have a 2nd gen dot plugged into my computer speakers and an original large echo and a 3rd gen dot.  The biggest question I have about many reviews here is the dunk on sound quality.  I have spent many years and lots of money (for me) to get good sound from my music systems.  The 3rd gen Dot was a real disappointment as the sound was so muddy.  The bass was at the same time weak and bled over to the midrange, overpowering the higher frequencies.  With it's front firing speaker, the 4th gen is so much clearer.  I don't expect real bass from a device this small, but at least the sound is balanced now.

There's a big reason most of Alexa's ""skills"" have such low ratings, even if Amazon says a device is ""compatible with Alexa"" you'll still have to download a third party app, set up the new device separately and there's a really good chance it still won't work.Most skills have a 2-3 star rating because it's such a pain to get them to work if they even work at all, and these are from products that someone at Amazon has verified work with Alexa...

Very inconvenient!) After more than 2 hours on the phone & more iterations of diagnostic steps than I can remember, we determined that the Kasa TP-Link software needed to be updated & all Alexa & Kasa devices, including my wireless router, needed to be rebooted by disconnecting power & restarting them. The rep followed a script initially, but soon exhausted that & resorted to basically ""trial & error"". The good news is that, after a week of flaky Alexa performance, I have been able to use Alexa to control my Kasa switches for 24 hours without interruption. Wooo hooo!

Thankfully I watched videos of side by side comparisons and read articles rather than depending solely on reviews. Still, the reviews gave me pause, and so I bought both because they were an amazing price (Black Friday), figuring I'd keep both if I really fell in love with them. (I've never had any device like this before.) I played a couple of different songs with both devices, switching back and forth, and I chose songs with a lot of variation, treble, bass, harmonies, etc. as well as acoustic sections. The 4th Gen quality was better on all counts...much crisper, fuller, clearer. HOWEVER: I would absolutely not waste the money to UPGRADE if you already have the 3rd Gen. The 3rd gen is perfectly fine, and the last thing we need is to encourage consumption culture and get the next version every time. But if you, like me, have the choice about which one to buy, I would say it's definitely worth the extra $10 (or only $5 difference if on sale) to get the 4th Gen. I'll be returning my 3rd Gen (it's still in perfect condition) and hope it can go to someone who wants to save a few bucks, given that the functionality is essentially the same.

,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2020","The sound quality of this new Echo Dot, 4th Generation, definitely missed the mark with sound.  Sadly, it sounds very tinny.  I’m surprised.  I’ve given 3rd Generation, small round, echo dots for gifts.  The sound between the two can’t compare.I should have gotten a remote, because when I ask Alexa to lower the music, it’s hard to get it low enough on the first try.  Also, when I use the little button on top to lower music, after awhile you can see a fingerprint.  That’s just oil on the hands being transferred.  I do use the Alexa App to change sound as well.To muffle the tinny sound, I take a Kleenex and wrap the round echo with the Kleenex.  The Kleenex is a buffer, it helps with the sound.  Makes the tinny sound not noticeable.I didn’t get 3rd generation because I wanted the new shape, and I thought I was getting updated quality.  Also, at the time I ordered the Round, 4th generation, the price was better and they had it in stock.

,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2021","There are so many things wrong with the echo dot and the Alexa app that controls it that I'd have to write a book to explain them all, so I'll just touch on how bad it is as a DAC.Can it play music in multiple rooms? Sorta. Surprisingly enough it doesn't have auto-syncing for the devices, so even though it can theoretically hear that it's out of sync, it doesn't do anything about it. What's worse is that there's no manual way to sync the devices like with Chromecast devices, so when it's out of sync (which is pretty much always) you're out of luck.Want to plug it into a home theater or stereo system? You better keep them on literally all the time or you won't be able to hear Alexa. When you plug in an aux cable, it completely disables the internal speaker. So if you say, turn off you home theater or stereo when you're not using them to save energy... Alexa will just send all its audio to the dead aux cable. You might think to say ""Alexa, I can't hear you""... but it does nothing. Maybe there's a setting in the Alexa app? Nope. The ""Internal Speaker"" setting means aux out if there's a cable plugged in. So if you want to check the weather before you run out the door the dialogue becomes ""Alexa, turn on home theater"" ...[wait a few seconds for the system to power on]... ""Alexa, what's the weather?"" ...[wait while Alexa says her stuff]... ""Alexa, turn off the stereo""The Alexa software is ultimately full of unfinished bits and pieces of spaghetti coded software like this that ends up completely defeating the point of a ""smart home system"" as it makes everything more tedious. And as you research the problems you're having you'll see that most of them are bugs that have been around 3-7 years (it literally still has some bugs that have been around since it first launched in 2014) and Amazon just chooses to ignore them. (Fun fact: the feedback form on the Alexa website is broken as of the time of this writing so you couldn't even complain about the bugs if you wanted)Oh, and I've had Alexa randomly start blasting music in the middle of the night while I was sleeping, and it wouldn't respond to ""Alexa, stop playing music"" x 5 or ""Alexa, mute yourself"" x 2 before I had to literally pull the power cable so I could go back to sleep.If you just want a kinda sub-par smart speaker that's just going to control a couple of smart bulbs or something simple like that, then the echo dot is probably fine. Otherwise, I would recommend looking to other brands or waiting a decade or two for Amazon to finally get around to fixing their bugs if you're really committed to getting an Echo.",Impressively bad as a multi-room DAC,,1.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Twilight Blue,Configuration: Echo Dot,Joe,Verified Purchase

It only responds when it wants to, and sometimes it just chimes or says “sorry, I didn’t catch that” when NOBODY is even talking let alone talking to the Alexa. Idk if I got a botched echo or if they’re all like this, but I have no idea how Amazon can justify the price for this when it does not work properly. Seriously, here are just a few of the other “perks” that come with the echo:1. When paired with a fire stick, it automatically searches for movies/shows on the fire tv app, despite being told to “play shrek on Hulu” or “search DC movies on HBO Max.” It just responds with “sure, playing [blank] on fire tv,” at which point the Echo just tried to charge you money for the rental in the fire tv app.2. Sometimes, it just decides to not recognize a paired device in the Alexa app. For example, we have some smart bulbs in the kitchen and we’ve labeled “kitchen lights “ in the app. But there’s a 50/50 change that when we say “Alexa, turn on kitchen lights” she either turns them in OR she says “I’m not seeing anything called kitchen lights, check the Alexa app for available devices.” It really makes the whole “smart” aspect of the smart lightbulbs useless, especially since it’s about $30 for four smart bulbs.3. If you use the echo to set a timer, you basically have to unplug if when you want the timer to stop blaring because Alexa doesn’t respond to “Alexa stop” or “Alexa turn off the timer”4. If you want to dim your smart bulbs to approximately 30%, the echo just turns off all but one light bulb. Whereas, when we would ask our google home to dim smart bulbs, it would actually dim all the selected smart bulbs instead of just turning off certain/nearly all the bulbs and claiming its work is done.5. Sometimes it just turns on and tells us the weather or says “I can’t do that” even though nobody has said anything to the echo or mentioned “Alexa.”On my next day off, I’ll try to update my review with videos of the echo and these “perks” so that potential buyers can witness exactly what I’m talking about.",It only functions when it wants to,,1.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Charcoal,Configuration: Echo Dot,C Jacks,Verified Purchase

At random times when I say the wake word at the same volume and distance(sometimes with my mouth just 5 inches away) that activates it, it doesn't work. Very unpredictable and kind of unreliable. Very very annoying at times when I say or ask such simple short things and have to repeat over and over like 4 or 5 times. Sometimes I say its wake word(at the same volume) inches away and other times a yard or two away and it works, at other times it does not. Very very random. Don't relie on it to quickly say tasks or questions as you multitask and expect it to get it each time. Won't work will and will leave you getting distracted by it and repeating yourself. You have to be concentrated and expect it to not work.𝙁𝙡𝙚𝙭𝙞𝙗𝙞𝙡𝙞𝙩𝙮: helpful with academic questions(asking it things from 4 plus 4 and log5 minus 2, ""what's a tadpole"", etc.). It's basically a simple version of Google search in that. I have a Yahoo mail account and cannot link it because it only accepts Microsoft and Gmail and something else. On my Google calendar I have my birthday and mom's birthday on there, yet when I ask it "" when's my birthday?"" ""When's my mom's/her first name birthday?"" it says it can't tell me because it's not on my calendar. 𝘌𝘷𝘦𝘯 after I say ""my birthday is (month/day), mark it on my calendar,"" and it confirms it like ""I've set it on your calendar"" it still can't tell me my birthday when I ask. Just jokingly says  over and over again ""hmm.. Not sure. But I'm guessing it's in the next 365 days.""• When you say ""alexa, play ____,"" it plays it on Amazon Music by default. You have to either change the originally listed default music streamer on the app(iHeart Radio and Amazon Music and something else are on the list). You can log in to your Spotify through the Alexa app. If Spotify isn't your default though, you have to say ""play ___ on Spotify"" each time. It saysssss on the app that if I set Spotify as my default on the podcast/music options, I do not have to say ""... on Spotify"" ever again. Yet I do. Every time. Or else it goes to Amazon Music.

Back with the previous gen dot, I needed Internet to get anything done, so I was surprised I could get dates and times when my Internet went out, but I was disappointed that I still needed Internet for timers. In my mind, timers should not need Internet at all if date and time can be retrieved without Internet.Second, network connectivity diagnosis can be a pain in this generation. Back in the 3rd generation, if there were troubles with Internet, I would know, thanks to the light indicator, but in this generation, the light is always blue, with Internet connectivity only noted via audio feedback. If things had stayed like the third generation, where the light is only blue if Alexa fully functioned, then this would definitely be an improvement.Overall, the product is one step forward and one step back, and I think Amazon really should have considered doing better, but still gives me what I want.",Nice but a little weird compared to previous gen,,4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Charcoal,Configuration: Echo Dot,Bryce Campbell,Verified Purchase

When Alexa has a notification or message for me, my tv will display a yellow line across the bottom border, which can only be disabled, as I had to learn through hours of internet research, by going into settings on the tv and deactivating all of my privacy permissions. By doing this, I forfeit the use of my voice commands to my tv. I understand that many people will want all of their devices linked together, but it seems a bit extreme and intrusive to me, and does nothing to help with the paranoia that I am being recorded at all times.

When the new 4th Gen Dot came out, I got one in Dec 2000.  The sound is ok but I personally couldn't detect a huge difference in quality over my older Dots.  The underlight is neither better nor worse than the older models.  I have no idea why the power supply changed to a much bigger one or why it and the power cord are white while the Dot itself is charcoal.  An odd choice in my opinion and the charger is harder to position in some outlet locations due to it's size and the much larger shape and size of the Dot .  None of these factors really added any value to justify the higher cost to me.  After about 5 months, the Dot stopped working.  Alexa told me she could not connect to the internet.  I unplugged it and restarted and it worked for a while but then stopped again.  I even reinstalled it in the app just in case.  I also moved it into the same room my wireless router is in to see if it was a signal strength issue but it still would not connect.  I checked Amazon to see if I could get it replaced but the warranty date was passed.  Shortly after this I saw that the new Dot was on sale so I bought another one about Mid June thinking perhaps my first one was just a bad unit.

One reason is that when you call up pop music you may not always get the version you remember. For example, calling up Chuck Berry's ""Johnny B. Goode"" will get you not the concise early studio version but a longer. later live version that has a lot of filler and omits the last verse. Also, the Alexa voice, after a brief trial period, will try to sell you at four dollars per month a version that allows you to call up precisely the music you want. If you don't subscribe to this service, what you get may not be what you want. For example, if you ask for the 17th piano sonata of Mozart, you won't get it but something like it--unless you pay for the service. The problem for me is that nearly everything to which I want to listen is available on You Tube and with visuals for the most part. So what is the advantage of Alexa? I couldn't see it, but if  you can and it's vital to you to call up what you want, and you don't mind the nearly fifty dollars per year subscription, then go for it.

If you're thinking about it, DON'T DO IT!1) The 4th gen devices don't seem to pick up voice commands as well.  We frequently use the Echo in our family room on the 1st floor.  Even though we are 5 feet away and within line of sight of the Echo, our Echo show upstairs in a room with a *closed* door hears the command instead and prevents the family room Echo from responding.  The activity logs indicate the Echo Show wasn't the intended device, but ultimately none of them respond so we have to repeat the command.2) The sound is awful.  The previous Echo's had a nice range and good base.  The 4th gen echo sounds very hollow and tinny.  The 4th gen echo dot is pure garbage and the previous dot sounded better than even the full 4th gen Echo.  If you like to listen to music through your Echo, avoid the 4th gen devices!!3) The light ring is now on the bottom of the Echo, so unless the device is placed at a position lower than you, you probably won't be able to see it.  Considering the mic can't pick up your commands well, you'll often wonder if it's doing anything at all since you get no indications.While not a 4th gen specific issue, the Echo is going to constantly be trying to upsell you on Amazon services.  If you request a song that isn't on Prime, it's going to try and upsell you their Ultimate Music service, then it's going to start playing some ""station"" that is not the song you request.  100% of the time I have to further request that it stop playing the station, which it can't hear me well so I end up yelling for it to stop 4 or 5 times.

I was a fan of the original puck design and, while this new ball design is probably the reason the speakers are better quality, it's just ugly to me.  There is more fabric surface, which catches dust and is impossible to clean properly.  The buttons are on a curved surface which makes them hard to use and it's harder to place than the old design.  You actually have to have a 'spot' for it where the old ones would fit most anywhere.Also, I don't prefer the new charge cable.  It's more a proprietary design with a barrel plug instead of the micro USB.  Why not just leave it be so we can use whatever charge cable we wish?

,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2021","I really like Echo products and Alexa in general but the speakers on this item are terrible, even with tuning in the Alexa app, and while it *can* connect to Bluetooth or AUX speakers, that's not ideal for a device that is (1) in my living room without room for another speaker, and (2) supposed to be a smart *speaker* itself. In my opinion, if a speaker doesn't sound good, don't buy. That's just me though, and yes, I know it was a cheap speaker so I'm not upset or anything. The main reason for my 3 stars is because Alexa's voice on this thing is so muffled I have to have the volume at 5 to hear her voice that sounds like she is wearing 25 masks so I can't use her at night because 5 is so loud that even just the sound of her muffling would wake everyone up. Also, placement is key as the microphones aren't that great. I have to be very loud when I call Alexa and pause for a few seconds after I say her name or she'll think I was talking to someone else and turn off, something Siri or Google Assistant don't do. I find myself asking her the same question 2 - 3 times before having her answer for this reason. It's an amazing device, don't get me wrong. Just not as convenient and ""fit into your life"" as Amazon makes it seem. This is most certainly a device that will drive non-techie people insane if they try to use. For this reason, I am the only one in my home who uses Alexa and everyone else strictly only uses the HomePods in our home because Siri is just easier to use, despite being arguably less knowledgable.",It's okay,,3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Charcoal,Configuration: Echo Dot,Luke,Verified Purchase

,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2021","In this 4th generation Dot, Alexa's voice is clearer and more distinct (there is noticeably more treble in her voice) compared to the 3rd generation Dot. As a result, you can hear what Alexa is saying from farther away and with more extraneous noise in the room. However, the bass is not as full and rich-sounding compared to the gen-3 Dot, possibly by as much as 20 percent. I really DO like the improvement in the treble. But for listening to music, I choose to use my 3rd generation Dot, of which I have three. Hopefully, in a future 5th generation Dot, Amazon will be able to keep the richness of bass of the 3rd gen Dot plus the improvement in the treble of the 4th gen Dot. By the way, in case you don't already know this; the bass, mid-range and treble characteristics of all generation Dots can be adjusted by the user using voice commands (e.g., ""Alexa, set the bass to plus 6,"" ""Alexa, set the treble to minus 2,"" etc.).","Alexa's voice is clearer, but music sounds worse",,3.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Charcoal,Configuration: Echo Dot,Jim,Verified Purchase

Only on rare occasions does it kinda screw up what I tell it, but that's rare.  The only real complaint is the sound quality is not very good.  It's not terrible, but the major problem with it is sounds dirty and distorted, almost like the speaker can't handle the wattage being put out.

I wish there is a way to manage the sensitivity and range of the motion sensor. Yes, music starts playing when somebody enters the room, but also music starts playing every time somebody walks in the hallway in front of the room (the door of the room has to be always open). I have moved the Echo and set it at different angles but the problem persists.2. The Alexa action ""People aren't Detected"" does not work. Even when the person leaves the room, music continues playing forever, the only way to make it stop is with a voice command or set a timer for the music to stop after a certain time which defeats the purpose if the person still is in the room when the timer is up.3. It seems once the motion sensor is triggered by the presence of a person, the sensor does not work for about 30 minutes after it was triggered. When the first person enters the room, Alexa plays music (I have it with the timer), then the first person leaves the room. Then if within 30 minutes another person (or the same one) enters the room, Alexa does nothing, no music starts playing.4. Everything else works normally (I haven't tried all the features), the quality of the sound is good taking in account that the speaker is very small.Please fix all these bugs with the motion sensor.

The 4th gen is notably different in speaker quality when compared to the 3rd generation dot. I'm not sure if this is something that can be fixed in a software update or something, but it's SO bad on the 4th generation dot. The 4th gen sounds extremely tinny, equivalent to that of like a $10-15 Bluetooth speaker (yes, that bad!). I have multi-room setup on the speakers throughout my house and when walking from the bathroom (3rd gen) to my room (4th gen) I heard an unpleasant drop in speaker quality. So I sat there trying to mess with the equalizer and all and nothing! These are either bad and cheap sounding speakers or just optimized poorly. If you have the chance to get the 3rd gen, definitely stay with buying the 3rd gen.Also, kind of just a nit-pick here, but I'm sure others will agree this was a bad decision by Amazon... Why ship all of the new 4th gen dots with a WHITE cord instead of corresponding with the color dot you bought?? I bought the charcoal dot and thought I received the wrong color cord, to the point where I reached out to the customer support and asked if this was the case. It was definitely intentional, so I bought a wall mount and threw it up cause it was an eye sore for how my room is set up.If you happened to skip the read above, JUST BUY THE 3RD GENERATION DOT!!",Get the 3rd Gen Dot | Speakers Are Horrendous,,1.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Twilight Blue,Configuration: Echo Dot,Lowdie,Verified Purchase

Took several attempts to get the device to connect to the primary wi-fi. The second Echo Dot is adjacent to the Samsung TV (which has it's own Alexa control, except for on and off). The plan was to use the Echo Dot to control the on/off and all of the other TV controls (channel changing, cable box interface, etc.) After removing Alexa control from the TV's internal Alexa app, the Echo Dot works about 50% of the time. Typically it will not turn the TV on and off with any consistency. If it does, on some occasions it works as advertised, changing channels while interconnected to the cable box. However, in more frequent instances when asked to change channels it responds with ""OK"", but the channel doesn't change or it responds with ""if using another AV device, you will need to connect that device"".

The sound is not bad and depending on placement the “split stereo” is apparent for playing music but not for TV since my TV does not support multiple speakers for stereo only mono when connected through Bluetooth.  There is not a balance feature to adjust sound level on left or right but I am fine with that was not expecting great sound for under $40.

I  am also a Prime member so I play music on Amazon Music but the speaker will support Apple Music if you have a subscription.  Sorry Google your Nest speaker could not do that kept going to You Tube music so I returned.Also there is a built in Guard feature which can be turned on to listen for glass breaking and send a notification alert to your phone.  I tested with an app (yes there is an app for that) it worked but determined the sound must be within about 10 feet.  You also have home and away settings which you can tell Alexa to perform certain functions turn on lights, activate guard etc so it can act as a basic security device somewhat.

My entire family has Echo Dots, which means we can send transcribed/recorded messages or video chat!  And if you’re using a laptop, tablet, phone or tv with HD picture, your video chat’s clarity is absolutely flawless!  And if that’s not enough, you only need to (this is the hard part) drop your manners) and ORDER Ziggy, Echo, or Alexa - as the case may be - to play __name of song__ by __name of band or singer__  , and so it shall be, oh master/mistress/lady or lord … The preceding “please” is difficult to quit - until you realize it’s a robot… of sorts.

I have mine set up to stream a variety of music genres from 9am-9pm (Amazon Music because i figured that would be the least problematic) but even with nothing else using my WiFi it's performance isn't as consistent as it should be and if you'd like to use a mobile WiFi hotspot it cuts out even worse.  It shows the signal as being connected but it's terrible.  Tech support people are nice but they didn't tell me anything I didn't know and never even brought up the recommended solution of getting as many of your other devices off the wifi (which is just unacceptable anyway, especially when your Fire Cube tells you that your signal is very strong and that's the only other connected device) and they agree that you should be frustrated so what does that tell you?  The sound quality is adequate for the price I paid ($18 for the unit with the smart plug costing $16) but that low price is the tipoff for what it's really worth across the board.  Not much in the way of midrange and bass just isn't there.  If you're listening to news or podcasts it's adequate enough, the tweeter is actually quite clear and powerful.  If you want good sound on it's own you'll probably be disappointed.  I hooked mine up with the aux output to a set of low-end computer speakers with a subwoofer and took care of that satisfactorily.

,"Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2021","Here are the biggest things about Alexa that I've encountered that really disappointed me or were a setback to what I wanted to do with my smart speaker:1) Alexa will keep playing the next episodes of a podcast by default if you ask her to ""play the latest episode"" and there is no way to change this setting that I've been able to find after extensive googling and trying different workarounds or skills without success.  Why this is a problem: It essentially makes it impossible to integrate listening to just one podcast episode as part of an Alexa routine. If you put ""play the latest episode of X podcast"" into a routine, Alexa won't be able to execute any action that comes after this, because she'll be stuck in an endless loop of playing podcast episodes. This is especially frustrating because it would be SUCH AN EASY FIX!!! Alexa already knows when a podcast episode has finished playing; all that's needed is a setting to disable auto-play, or even better a voice command that specifies that you only want ONE episode, e.g. ""Alexa play ONLY the latest episode of X podcast.""2) There should be a command to ""toggle"" the power of a smart home device, meaning ""If the device is on, turn it off, and if the device is off, turn it on."" You might be thinking who would ever want that but this feature would actually allow for much ""smarter"" smart home control. For example, let's say you want to have the lights come on every time you enter your bedroom, and turn off every time you leave. If Alexa had a toggle feature for smart devices, you could use the following routine to achieve this with a smart motion sensor just outside your door (i.e. it's activated whenever you enter or leave your room):When motion sensor detects motion:toggle bedroom light.Easy.

If you think these echo units are trivial to set up, they are not. You will have a hard time finding instructions about how to use most of the advertised features. Amazon gives features lots of cute names like ""SKILLS"" that I am sure the programmers who wrote the code love and understand  but you will find the Alexa app to be an endless, badly organized drill down of menus from hell. The App on your phone is a long scrolling list of what are intended to be guesses by Amazon of things you might like to do. I was surprised at how unfriendly this app is after all these years of Alexa. DO NOT buy this and mail to Grandma or Grandpa, or even Mom or Dad as a help device, because it is very likely they will not even get it set up on the internet. These kinds of devices are really just computers that have no keyboard, no mouse, no screen, and some imperfect voice recognition. If you get as far as trying to making your own ""Skills"", good luck. Skills need to get approved by Amazon and they seem to reject skills that they think might link to any potentially sensitive topic in the media.

Adding a user often unintentionally makes the new user the ""owner"" user as they try to make sense of Alexa App prompts and audio prompts from the echo. Then you need to reset your echo again.  Alexa's failed attempts to make a phone call is often entertaining as much as frustrating, and Alexa will only offer to call ONE number for a contact, but not offer a way to call another number (cell versus home phone for example).

I'm not overreacting whenever I say the difference is night and day. I had both dots turned to a volume level of four. I played indie rock, punk rock, '90s alternative, '90s hip-hop and even threw some current pop songs on that my kids like. Every style of music I played sounded inferior on the new dot compared to the last generation. Perhaps if you've never heard music played out of a previous generation echo Dot then you will be okay.

Cheap is anyway food of lazy.Amazon products are in there infancy. They have little to no use. Amazon wants people to buy the cheaper versions of alexa for a reason.Speaking about Alexa, I use to play music. I am already a prime customer, but whenever i try to ask this guy to play something she cant becuase that music is part of amazon unlimited and not in regular amazon music subscription. So basically, amazon wants you to pay another 10$/ month to listen to your songs. If you are getting alexa for cheap, believe me they have a plan to make money afterwards.Also they say there is suppport for apps like spotify and apple music, but in my opinion alexa is rigged to not work properly with these apps. same song which can be easily identified on amazon music, will not produce exact result when you ask alexa to play on spotify or apple music. Literally wasting my spotify subscription.Go for google nest products. Cant stress this enough, but there voice recognition is way better. You have even have long conversations with it. Alexa cant even hear if you call it, during slightest disturbance. If you are playing music above 6 volume, alexa wont hear you. With Google nest you wont face this issue.Alexa is waste for now. Ask time, ask non sense that 2 days entertainment.

We are using Amazon Kids, and the filters have worked just fine. Word to the wise: If you have Audible and you use the Plus Catalog, the plus selections will NOT work if you have Amazon Kids set up on your device. I am pretty irritated about that since my kids are audio book junkies, but since we have music and all the other Audible titles that I've purchased with a credit or cash, we'll be okay.HOWEVER, the black Echo dot that I purchased had horrible sound. After hearing the blue one, I assumed I was in the clear. But there was a definite difference--the sound in the black one was more tinny and empty sounding, even after tweaking the sound levels. I am returning that one, because if I want to listen to music with a speaker like that, I'll just use my phone. :-/","One worked, the other didn't",,4.0 out of 5 stars,Color: Twilight Blue,Configuration: Echo Dot,Stephanie,Verified Purchase

However we bought them so everyone could have them in their bedroom and we have an echo show in the kitchen. I wanted to be able to sync the sound of all of them together which it does but also allow for everyone to listen to something different in their room which it does but the ability to switch between accounts and profiles is lacking. It recognizes everyone's voice but if I want to listen to spotify and my daughter wants to listen to her separate spotify account at the same time we can't do that.

,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2020","I am not usually one to write reviews, but I was so disappointed by this product that I had to write one.  I have several Echo Dots in my home and love the previous design (3rd Generation) When I went to purchase another, I found that this version (4th Generation) was the current offering.  Typically newer versions are improvements; however, I think this version of the Echo Dot is a step (or two) in the wrong direction.  Right out of the box, I noticed this Echo Dot seemed cheaply made.  A lot of plastic, round and with a “snapped together like a plastic Easter egg” appearance. Lacks the heft and durable feel of the previous version.  Even the cord is very generic and lacks the Amazon logo, and I literally went back to the website to make sure I didn’t mistakenly buy a cheap knock off brand.  It honestly looks like a low end Bluetooth speaker you’d get for a child.  Performance wise, this Echo Dot seems to lack the sensitivity of the previous version.  My others I can crank up and the devices can still hear any commands.  I found I had to frequently repeat myself to this version. No good.  And I don’t know if it is the round shape of the speaker or what, but the sound is not as good (especially at higher volumes) than the previous version.  The sound is not as rich or full and the volume doesn’t go as loud as the 3rd Generation.  At a higher volume, I felt the sound quality dropped.  In short, I love my Echo Dots but this version is a total downgrade.

Each new iteration is smaller, smarter, and more aesthetically pleasing than the last. The new Echo Dot is no exception. I have three of them placed at various spots around our home. They’re great for allowing us to voice command our TVs, lights, thermostat, Roomba, etc. from anywhere in the house.Installation is as easy as removing the plastic strip from the device and plugging it in. They will generally integrate themselves into your existing set up with very little assistance needed on your part. I like to segment mine into their various spaces of the house using the Alexa app. But if you’re just looking for a nice little speaker to ask the weather, add an item to your Amazon cart, or play some tunes, it’s perfect for that too.In terms of user friendly approachability, Amazon devices really shine.

,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2021","I work in speech analytics, and also have a friend who built a chatbot for a hobby several years ago which I’d train through casual discussion in my spare time. So to me, Alexa underwhelmingly serves the purpose of a fancy voice activated speaker in my home, but nothing more. It’s not natural to me to tell it to add items to my grocery list because it’s faster for me to add myself (partly because I group things mentally by aisle not by food type). I don’t care about news, sports, or stock headlines, so I don’t need those read off to me. And I live in a small, old,  rented apartment, so adding many of the touted smart home devices is a no-go for me due to space and outdated wiring capabilities.More specifically, despite being several gens in, Alexa’s response abilities are still shockingly subpar. If I ask to be read a page from Wikipedia and then don’t catch something she says, when I say “read that last sentence again”, she fries. If I say “turn on X and Y” she somehow thinks it’s one name and can’t find a device with the joint name so neither light is switched on.With the alarm ability, I can’t set a specific song partway thru an album; if I pick a specific song, that song plays once or looped on repeat (it’s not consistent). But if I tell her to play an album, it’s not visually clear in the app that the whole album will play (and sometimes only the first song plays and then also stops music). If I say “set alarm to play music by X artist” to avoid all of THAT, then the first song is by the artist and the subsequent songs are by other artists I would never remotely considered related, so I’m left distrustful and frustrated with even a basic alarm feature.The snooze feature is impossible to figure out and navigate, both vocally or in the app. And again in setting music for the alarm, you can’t pick free songs in Amazon music from the app, you have to verbally direct Alexa and good luck with her getting that right.So at this point until Alexa goes through either a massive overhaul or several impressive gens in short order, I wouldn’t recommend Alexa devices (though I haven’t tried any other home assistants to compare for quality).Complaints aside, having read Talk to Me by James Vlahos (highly recommended), I can appreciate all the hard work that’s gone into even the basic Alexa functions and call and response capabilities. But until things get to a point where I can say “Alexa, what are some great cocktail recipes?” and not receive the answering “Sure.

The previous speaker was at $20 dollars at one point, which completely beats the price of $50 of this newer one.
